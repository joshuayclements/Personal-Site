              <p>Journals, the documentary, is a compilation of interviews from people who knew the artist best and Cobain’s personal thoughts over the course of several years and in the month leading up to his tragic and controversial death. Kurt Cobain filled dozens of notebooks with lyrics, drawings, and writings about his plans for Nirvana and his thoughts about fame, the state of music, and the people who bought and sold him and his music. This documentary aims to reveal an artist who loved music, knew the history of rock, and who was determined to define his place history.</p>
